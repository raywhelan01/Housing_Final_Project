The data is filtered on five parameters 
**1.*** State
**2.*** Income
**3.*** Family Size

**Part 1 :**
Using HTML inputs tags user input is taken.  Using class and container functions a dynamic form is created and then these parameters were passed to the app.js file which is the master working file for filtering the data. <BR>

**Part 2 :** Using the functions the data is checked by passing the value as the argument to the function.  Based on the values dataset is filtered using D3 and .filter function to keep the data which matches with the argument passed to the function. A new table is created using build table function which displays the data on the website. <BR>
